                <p>Example calculation of metrics:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Suppose your renovation budget is 125K and you notice three properties on the MLS: property A is listed at 300K, property B is listed at 375K and property C is listed at 400K.</li>
                  <li>Assume all are without your budget for purchasing a home. The model predicts a resale value for all three of 500K. </li>
                  <li>Therefore, potential gain for A, B and C are 200K, 125K, and 100K, respectively.</li>
                  <li>In this case, property A (black) would be classified as a safe flip because $200K is greater than what you will presumably spend on your reno ($125K) + model error ($20K). </li>
                  <li>Property B is classified as a risky flip (gray) because you would basically just make your money back, and C (red) is a property to stay away from because the model predicts that you wouldn't make your money back. </li>
                </ul>
                    ROI is calculated as the percentage gain from your total investment. In the case of Property A, total investment would be $300K + $125K = $425K. If resale is 500K, then ROI is = $75/$425 = +0.17%.
